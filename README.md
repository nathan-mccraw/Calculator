### Summary
This project was challenging and fun to complete.  In the nature of trying new things, I implemented a single event listener on the div containing the calculator buttons and used the event.target to determine the user inputs.  I believe this made the project a denser than it should have been, but it was a fun challenge to undertake.  I also took the opportunity to build an object containing the user inputs, destructure it in a function argument, and use key-value pairs to update the inputs/outputs.  If I was to do this project again, which I am sure to, I would try to simplify the overall structure to not include the above mentioned implementations.
